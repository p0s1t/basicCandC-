# basicCandCplusplus
Code from my time in school of some elementary and intermediate programs written in C and C++

Typical stuff like a minesweeper program, a payroll program, and some basic sorting algorithms, and other things that one learns in the first few years of working with C. I helped design a simple terminal at one point, but that code is currently AWOL, so hopefully I'll run into one of my labmates or will find it in some backup folder somewhere. I say that to say that I do understand how to do simple sysadmin stuff like read job and process ID's from the terminal and create a queue for jobs, etc.
